Research Case Study: Understanding Web3 Security Incidents in 2023

Introduction:
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in security incidents in the Web3 space, impacting various blockchain projects and platforms. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of security incidents that occurred in 2023, shedding light on the causes, responses, and the flow of funds involved. For the sake of simplicity, let's dive into the research with an easy-to-understand narrative.

The Landscape of Web3 Security Incidents:
Imagine the digital world as a bustling city with various neighborhoods, each represented by a blockchain platform. In 2023, more than 300 security incidents hit this city, affecting different projects and causing damages exceeding $500,000 each. The incidents occurred on platforms like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and others, each having its own vulnerabilities and challenges.

Types of Attacks:
Exploits: Picture a castle, each with its unique defense mechanisms. However, attackers found clever ways to breach these defenses. There were 112 security incidents, averaging one every 3.2 days, causing a total loss of $1.83 billion. The most common attack was hacking due to contract vulnerabilities, like finding a secret passage into the castle.

Security Audits: Just like having inspectors check the castle's defenses, projects often undergo security audits to find weaknesses. Surprisingly, 83% of the projects had audits, but not all audits were foolproof. Some were like checking only certain parts of the castle, leaving hidden vulnerabilities.

Post-Incident Responses: When the castle is breached, what happens next? Only 43 out of 83 projects shared detailed reports about the incident. Think of this as the castle owner telling the town what happened and how they plan to prevent it in the future.

Stolen Funds: Now, imagine the thieves escaping with treasures. We tracked where the stolen funds went. Some used secret passages (cryptocurrency mixers), while others fled to neighboring kingdoms (cryptocurrency exchanges).

Noteworthy Examples:
Castle of Coins: A project called "Midas Capital" suffered a read-only reentrancy attack, a vulnerability inherited from a popular defense mechanism called Balancer. Despite losing $800,000, they recovered user funds effectively and even had insurance.

The Trojan Proposal: In one incident, attackers submitted a fake proposal in the castle's town hall, gaining control of the entire governance. This happened in a place called "Tornado.Cash." Fortunately, the attackers submitted a new proposal to cancel their own, saving the day.

Lessons Learned:
Castle Inspections: Even with security audits, castles need comprehensive checks. Imagine if only certain parts of a castle were inspected; vulnerabilities elsewhere could be missed.

Town Meetings: When incidents happen, it's essential for castle owners to share details with the town. This builds trust and ensures everyone is aware of potential dangers.

Treasure Recovery: Sometimes, stolen treasures can be recovered. Projects need robust post-incident responses, including compensating affected users and conducting additional security audits.

Conclusion:
Web3 security incidents are like challenges faced by a growing digital city. By understanding these incidents, castle owners (project developers) can strengthen their defenses and create a safer digital landscape for everyone. Just as townspeople share stories about challenges and victories, the Web3 community must collaborate to build a secure and resilient digital future.
