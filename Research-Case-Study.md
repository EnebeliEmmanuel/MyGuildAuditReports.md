# Research Case Study: Understanding Web3 Security Incidents in 2023

#
## Overview:
> In recent years, there has been a significant increase in security incidents in the Web3 space, impacting various blockchain projects and platforms. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of security incidents that occurred in 2023, shedding light on the causes, responses, and the flow of funds involved. For the sake of simplicity, let's dive into the research with an easy-to-understand narrative.

**The Landscape of Web3 Security Incidents**:
> Imagine the digital world as a bustling city with various neighborhoods, each represented by a blockchain platform. In 2023, more than 300 security incidents hit this city, affecting different projects and causing damages exceeding $500,000 each. The incidents occurred on platforms like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and others, each having its own vulnerabilities and challenges.

**Types of Attacks**:
**Exploits**: 
> Picture a castle, each with its unique defense mechanisms. However, attackers found clever ways to breach these defenses. There were 112 security incidents, averaging one every 3.2 days, causing a total loss of $1.83 billion. The most common attack was hacking due to contract vulnerabilities, like finding a secret passage into the castle.

**Security Audits**: 
> Just like having inspectors check the castle's defenses, projects often undergo security audits to find weaknesses. Surprisingly, 83% of the projects had audits, but not all audits were foolproof. Some were like checking only certain parts of the castle, leaving hidden vulnerabilities.

**Post-Incident Responses**: 
> When the castle is breached, what happens next? Only 43 out of 83 projects shared detailed reports about the incident. Think of this as the castle owner telling the town what happened and how they plan to prevent it in the future.

**Stolen Funds**: 
> Now, imagine the thieves escaping with treasures. We tracked where the stolen funds went. Some used secret passages (cryptocurrency mixers), while others fled to neighboring kingdoms (cryptocurrency exchanges).

**Noteworthy Examples**:
> Castle of Coins: A project called "Midas Capital" suffered a read-only reentrancy attack, a vulnerability inherited from a popular defense mechanism called Balancer. Despite losing $800,000, they recovered user funds effectively and even had insurance.

**The Trojan Proposal**: 
> In one incident, attackers submitted a fake proposal in the castle's town hall, gaining control of the entire governance. This happened in a place called "Tornado.Cash." Fortunately, the attackers submitted a new proposal to cancel their own, saving the day.

**Lessons Learned**:
> Castle Inspections: Even with security audits, castles need comprehensive checks. Imagine if only certain parts of a castle were inspected; vulnerabilities elsewhere could be missed.

**Town Meetings**: 
> When incidents happen, it's essential for castle owners to share details with the town. This builds trust and ensures everyone is aware of potential dangers.

**Treasure Recovery**:
> Sometimes, stolen treasures can be recovered. Projects need robust post-incident responses, including compensating affected users and conducting additional security audits.

## CompoundV2:  
### Empty Pool Attack
**Victims**:
> Hundred Finance (Apr 15)
> Midas Capital (Jun 17)
> Onyx Protocol (Nov 1)

**Overview**:
> Think of CompoundV2 as a popular recipe everyone's using to cook a dish. Unfortunately, some clever individuals found a way to manipulate the recipe and take more ingredients than they actually put in. This led to a shortage of supplies for several cooking projects like Hundred Finance, Midas Capital, and Onyx Protocol.

**Exploitation Technique**:
> It's like someone sneakily grabbing extra groceries when everyone's busy. In this case, the attackers manipulated things in the kitchen, depleting supplies and causing chaos in the cooking process.

**Related Examples**:
> Imagine if this recipe is widely shared, and many people are using it. Similar incidents occurred elsewhere, showing how important it is to fix the recipe to prevent future mishaps.

#
## Thirdweb:
### Thirdweb Vulnerability
**Victims**:
> Over 500 mainnet contracts
> Over 1000 BSC token contracts (Dec 7)

**Overview**:
> Thirdweb is like a toolbox for builders. Now, imagine if there's a flaw in one of the tools, and someone figures out how to use it to mess up several construction projects. That's what happened when attackers exploited Thirdweb, causing trouble for over 500 building sites.

**Exploitation Technique**:
> It's akin to a defective tool causing problems in construction. The attackers took advantage of this glitch, causing chaos in various building projects connected to Thirdweb.

**Related Examples**:
> Just like a faulty tool affecting multiple construction sites, similar vulnerabilities in other tools can have widespread consequences. It's a reminder to ensure all tools are in good shape.
#
## Governance 
### Governance Attacks
**Tornado.Cash (May 20)**:
> Imagine a small town where people make decisions together. An intruder submitted a proposal, including a button to destroy the town. Luckily, they reconsidered and submitted a new proposal to cancel the chaos they created.

#
## Atlantis
### Atlantis Loans (Jun 10):
> Picture a quiet neighborhood meeting. During a time when not many were paying attention, someone slipped in a fake proposal that granted them control over the whole community. They made off with everyone's belongings.

**Lesson Learned**:
> It's like ensuring everyone in the town actively participates in decisions. When people are vigilant, they can prevent malicious proposals from causing trouble.

#
## Stablecoin
### Stablecoin Depegging
**Tangible (Oct 13)**:
> Consider a company promising to always sell a product for $10. Suddenly, they struggle to get the materials needed, and the price jumps to $15. That's what happened when Tangible's stablecoin lost its promise due to collateral issues.

**Lesson Learned**:
> Just like the importance of a company securing stable supplies, stablecoins need to ensure a stable and diverse set of collateral to keep their promises.

#
## Lazarus
### Control Hijacking Attacks
**Lazarus Incidents**:
> Think of private keys as the keys to your house. Now, imagine a master thief getting hold of many keys and robbing multiple houses. That's what Lazarus did, causing huge losses.

**Noteworthy Cases**:
> It's like a master thief targeting different neighborhoods. Incidents involving Atomic Wallet, Alphapo, Coinspaid, Stake.com, CoinEx, and Poloniex show the magnitude of the problem.

**Lesson Learned**:
> Just as you'd protect your house keys, safeguarding private keys is crucial. It's a reminder to use top-notch security measures.

#
## Cypher
### Attacks with Complex Logic
**Cypher Protocol (Aug 7)**:
> Think of a lending system like a bank. Now, imagine a glitch allowing someone to take out loans they can never repay, leading to a financial mess. That's what happened with Cypher Protocol.

#
## KyberSwap
**KyberSwap (Nov 23)**:
> Consider a modified vending machine that accidentally dispenses double the items for the price. Exploiters used a similar bug in KyberSwap, stealing a significant amount.

**Lesson Learned**:
> Just like a bank needs foolproof systems, crypto projects must ensure their systems can't be exploited. It's a call for rigorous checks and balances.

#
## SturdyFinance
**Exemplary Case**: Sturdy Finance (Jun 12)
**Overview**:
Think of an online store facing a cyber-attack. Sturdy Finance was like that store, hit by an attack but resiliently recovering and keeping their customers' belongings safe.

**Post-Incident Actions**:
> It's like the store not only fixing the damage but also ensuring customers are compensated and protected in the future. Sturdy Finance's actions set an example for others.

**Lesson Learned**:
> Similar to a store having insurance, crypto projects need safety nets. Sturdy Finance's case shows the importance of learning from incidents and implementing robust security measures.

## Individual Case Analysis
> Imagine a detective breaking down each incident like solving a complex case. In-depth analyses cover everything from how the attack happened to what the affected projects did to recover. It's like understanding the details of a crime scene to prevent similar incidents in the future.



Conclusion:
Web3 security incidents are like challenges faced by a growing digital city. By understanding these incidents, castle owners (project developers) can strengthen their defenses and create a safer digital landscape for everyone. Just as townspeople share stories about challenges and victories, the Web3 community must collaborate to build a secure and resilient digital future.
