The audit was conducted by the QuillAudits team from October 26, 2021, to October 27, 2021. The source code for the audit was retrieved from the official GitHub repository at [GitHub Link].

### Vulnerability Summary

> The audit aims to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that AcknoLedger's smart contracts meet high-security standards. The severity levels are categorized into High, Medium, Low, and Informational, each representing the criticality of the identified issues.

## Critical Risks (No Critical Risks Found)

> Description: Imagine building a thrilling roller coaster. A critical risk would be a flaw in the coaster's structure that could lead to a disastrous ride. In AcknoLedger's case, there were no such critical flaws. It's like ensuring the roller coaster is not just thrilling but also safe for everyone.

>Implication: No critical risks mean the smart contracts have a strong foundation, much like a roller coaster that promises both excitement and safety.

## Major Risks (2 - 2 Resolved)

> Description: Think of major risks as potential bumps in the ride. They won't stop the roller coaster, but they could make the journey a bit shaky. AcknoLedger identified and fixed two such bumps during the audit.

> Implication: Resolving major risks is like ironing out those bumps, ensuring a smoother journey for users interacting with AcknoLedger.

## Medium Risks (1 - 1 Resolved)

> Description: Medium risks are like warning signs on the road. They indicate potential issues ahead. AcknoLedger found one such warning sign and promptly took care of it.

> Implication: Addressing medium risks is akin to removing those warning signs, making the road (smart contracts) safer and more user-friendly.

## Low Risks (1 - Open)

> Description: Low risks are minor issues, like a squeaky door. It's not a big problem, but fixing it would make things better. AcknoLedger has one such minor issue still open.

> Implication: While low-risk, addressing this issue is like oiling the squeaky door â€“ a small improvement that adds to the overall user experience.

## Informational Errors (1 - Resolved)

> Description: Informational errors are suggestions for improvement, similar to feedback on a product. AcknoLedger received one suggestion and acted on it during the audit.

> Implication: Resolving informational errors is like implementing user feedback â€“ making the smart contracts better based on constructive suggestions.

## In Essence
